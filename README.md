# Spotify Data Cleaning & Exploration

This project explores a large public dataset of global Spotify chart data (3GB+).
I am exploring the basics of data exploration, analysis, and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib

## What I Did

- Loaded a large CSV dataset using Pandas
- Cleaned and renamed key fields (e.g. `title` -> `track_title`)
- Converted date strings to a usable format
- Analyzed top streamed songs and top artists in the U.S.
- Created visualizations using Matplotlib
- Exported the cleaned dataset and plots
